                        While training isn't a necessity for guinea pigs to be effective emotional support animals, it can enhance the relationship between the animal and its owner. Concerns around compatibility with other pets or the level of attention required are often mitigated by the guinea pig's adaptable nature and ability to coexist with other animals when introduced properly.
