                        <p class="text-lg-end">
                            Guinea pigs, commonly known as cavies, have emerged as popular emotional support animals due to their gentle and affectionate nature. These small rodents are sociable and known for forming strong emotional bonds with their owners, making them excellent companions for individuals in need of emotional support.

                    <p>
                        While training isn't a necessity for guinea pigs to be effective emotional support animals, it can enhance the relationship between the animal and its owner. Concerns around compatibility with other pets or the level of attention required are often mitigated by the guinea pig's adaptable nature and ability to coexist with other animals when introduced properly.
